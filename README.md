# iCart Mobile Application

Simplifying healthcare operations through software.

## About
In most hospital emergency rooms, healthcare workers must look up important information relating to procedures for administering medicine, IV drips, etc. manually in a written resource binder. These binders are often hundreds-thousands of pages long, and only a small proportion of it is relevant for a single patient. The purpose of the iCart mobile application is to display the information in these resource binders in a much more accessible and condensed way, such that only information relevant to the current patient is displayed.

The application allows input of patient data including age, weight, etc. (private details like patient name are not iputted) and displays only the suggested procedures, medicine, and dosages relevant to the patient in an intuitive and accessible UI. The app also keeps track of the time and amount for when medicine/IV is admnistered, includes a timer with alarms, and other features.
